title: What is a Digital Garden?
---

I (Niky Dix) have been inspired to create this Digital Garden, to help people flourish.

Gardens that help people flourish in life are not new! Frances Hodgson Burnett wrote about her life giving secret garden in 1911! 

I was inspired by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) who herself was inspired by some other really clever people!

A Digital Garden is different from a traditional blogs or website in 2 ways. 

1) A blog typically focuses on a single topic at once (though it may contain hyper links through to other topics), and has a pubished date. 

If I want to learning in public with you through a traditional blog, I would learn something in private, then write about it, then publish it, and eventually you might read it. 

A digital Garden is not published in one go, but grows and evolves, just like a real Garden! This means, I will be writing here and learning at the same time, and you will be able to peek in and watch or see what I learn!

A digital Garden is also different in that it is not a linear stream of content. Instead, it is known as Topographic! This means all the different posts and articles create a landscape of different topics, that are related and that can be freely explored, again, just like a real garden!

You can chose your path through the Garden, depending on what you want to explore! I think of it like one of those 'choose your own adventure stories'

<h2> What will I be learning? </h2>

There are a few branches of learning I'll be sharing in this Garden. 

These may include: 
1) Building this website and digital Garden!

2) Applied Positive Psychology & Coaching Psychology concepts

3) How this Applied Psychology and Coaching connects with Intentional Health's Charity work. 

<h2>Why will I share this learning with you?</h2>

I want to share this learning with you, becuase I want my Garden to help us all to flourish in life. 

You might have to be patient, as I am still in the "preparing the land" phase of development! so just like you have to wait for seeds to grow, you'll also have to be patient with the content growing in here, as it will also be growing organically! 

<h3>What to expect?</h3>

I expect the first seeds will be sown shortly after my degree starts at the end of September, so please come back then!

Once the garden begins to be planted, you can expect to find 3 stages of content, in various format's!

<h3>Seedlings</h3>
These are newly planted, are in the early stages, and probably won't really look anything like what they will eventually grow into! These will be my early ideas and understandings as the topics are introduced. 

I'll be sharing these as you might be interested to find out more about what I'm planting though, so you can come back and watch it grow.

<h3>Budding Ideas</h3>

These will be notes taking shape and starting to blossom. Idea's will be rapidly forming, and you may begin to find things helpful.

<h3>Evergreen Notes</h3>
