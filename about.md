I (Niky Dix) have been inspired to create this Digital Garden, to help people flourish.

Gardens that help people flourish in life are not new! [Frances Hodgson Burnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Garden) wrote about a secret garden back that improved the health of a little boy back in 1911! 

This Garden is not a secret Garden though, it's a Digital Garden! A public place, where all are welcome! Though just like Frances Hodgson Burnett's Garden, I hope it breathes life into all who visit :) 

I was inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Maggie Appleton,</a> who herself was inspired by some other really clever people! And I hope to use this Garden to share my learning, as I study a MSc in Applied Positive Psychology and Coaching Psychology.

A Digital Garden is different from a traditional website or blog in 2 ways. 

1) A blog typically focuses on a single topic at once (though it may contain hyper links through to other topics), and has a pubished date. 

If I wanted to learning in public with you through a traditional blog, I would learn something in private, then write about it, then publish it, and eventually you might read it. 

A digital Garden is not published in one go, but grows and evolves, just like a real Garden! This means, I will be writing here and learning at the same time, and you will be able to peek in and watch or see what I learn!

A digital Garden is also different in that it is not a linear stream of content. Instead, it is known as Topographic! This means all the different posts and articles create a landscape of different topics, that are related and that can be freely explored, again, just like a real garden!

You can chose your path through the Garden, depending on what you want to explore! I think of it like one of those 'choose your own adventure stories' 

You can find out more about what I'll be studying by signing up for my Garden Digest!
