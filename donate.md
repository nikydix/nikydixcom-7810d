I gave up my teaching career in 2009 to be able to make a bigger impact, improving lifestlye health and wellbeing.

I founded 'Intentional Health CIO' to improve lifestyle health and reduce health inequalities. do this, which is a registered Chritable Incorporated Organisation, England & Wales (1152310). It exists 

I have been joined by a number of volunteers around the country, and can  focus on this work because a few "Intentional Health Angels" support this work financially. 

It means people who want to be part of this Intentional Health family, but don't have the time to give, can financially support the work we don't have the money to do! Just another great example of people coming together to do more collectively than we can individually :)

Becoming an 'Angel' also provides an opportunity for people who have been positively impacted by Intentional Health to be able to 'pay-it-forward' for someone else.

If you would like to join and become an angel too, please [click here](http://intentionalhealth.uk/angels/) to find out more.

Alternatively, you can make a one off donation below if you want to directly support the learning that is going on alongside this charitable work! 

Thanks for your consideration, what ever you choose :)
