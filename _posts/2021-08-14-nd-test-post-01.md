I have been inspired to create this Digital Garden, to learn in public. 

I have been inspired to do this by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) who herself was inspired by some other really clever people! 

A Digital Garden is a way of doing this. It is different from a traditional blogs in 2 ways. 

1) A digital blog tends to focus on a single topic at once (though it may contain hyper links through to other topics), and they have a pubished date. 

If I want to share my learning with you, I would learn something, then write about it, then publish it, and you would read it.
